    # Versions are created as follows (In helm 3.7 and above OCI reference tags
    # must be valid SemVer):
    # - Tags starting with v will be released as what comes after `v`. (e.g. refs/tags/v1.0 -> 1.0).
    # - Master branch will be released with `master` as version tag for the docker images and
    #   `0.0.0-master` tag for helm chart.
